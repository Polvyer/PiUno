This project implements an Internet Radio utilizing the Raspberry Pi and Arduino
Uno. The Pi runs the music player and outputs its sound to speakers. The Arduino
operates the radio via buttons pressed. An external Arduino interacts with the radio
through either a port interface or through sound waves generated by the radio. The Pi
communicates with the main Arduino via a specific firmware that will make the Arduino
be operated by the Pi through Python code running on the Pi itself. Almost every
component is connected via wires when the physical radio gets assembled.
